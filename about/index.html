                    <p><strong>To provide men and women who have committed their lives to full Christian service a general overview of the Bible and of the Christian Ministry.</strong> To this Biblical foundation, we include basic training for preaching, mission work and other areas of vocational Christian service.</p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The Ilocandia Liberty Bible Baptist Institute is a <strong>venture of Faith</strong>. When the Ilocandia Liberty Bible Baptist Fellowship was formally organized on November 25, 2002, the officers, pastors and workers cited the need for a training ground of Christians so that they would be equipped in carrying out the Great Commission of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>However, realizing such a dream was not easy because the new fellowship had nothing: no funds and no other facilities for running a school. Given these constraints, a series of consultations followed, not only among the pastors and workers but with the members of the fellowshipping churches.</p>

                <p>With God's blessing, these efforts bore fruit. <strong>Able and competent workers volunteered to teach in the school, and churches agreed to make financial commitment to support students.</strong> Because of these efforts from the ILBBF churches, the school welcomed its first batch of students at the start of the academic year 2003-2004 at the compound of Bible Baptist Church, Barani, City of Batac, Ilocos Norte.</p>
