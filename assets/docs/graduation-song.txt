# "Use Me Lord"
## ILBBI Graduation Song

Use my life Lord to serve Your people
And follow You wherever You may lead
Let everything I do reveal my trust in You
Your faithful witness I will be

Use my hands Lord to help Your people
And share the many blessings I receive
Let every warm embrace
Reflect Your love and grace
So all may know You and believe

**Use me Lord to be a true disciple**
**Use me Lord to comfort and forgive**
**Guide my way as I follow You in faith**
**And serve You every day I live**

Take my life and let it be
Used to serve You faithfully
Show me Lord what You have planned
Help me live as You command
Help me live as You command

Use my voice Lord to teach Your people
And tell the hope and promise of Your word
Let every song I raise
Resound in grateful praise
To share my joy with all the world

**Use me Lord to be a true disciple**
**Use me Lord to comfort and forgive**
**Guide my way as I follow You in faith**
**And serve You every day I live**

**Take my life and use me Lord**
